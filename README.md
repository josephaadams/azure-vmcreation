<h1>Virtual Machine (VM) Creation Using Microsoft Azure</h1>
This guide walks you through the step-by-step process of creating a Virtual Machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure under a specific resource group.<br />


<h2>What is a Resource Group?</h2>
A Resource Group is a container in Azure that holds related resources for an Azure solution. These resources could include Virtual Machines (VMs), storage accounts, virtual networks, and more.

<h2>Why Should You Use a Resource Group?</h2>

- Organization: Resource groups make it easy to group and manage resources that belong to the same project or workload.

Example: All resources for a web application (VM, database, storage) can be grouped together in one resource group.

- Access Control: You can assign role-based access to a resource group, controlling who can manage the resources within it.

- Cost Management: Resource groups provide a clear view of costs for all the resources within them. This helps you monitor and optimize spending.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure: Hosting the virtual machine.

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

**1. Working Computer with Internet Access** (If you don't know how to create a VM using azure, check out my guide: **********REPLACEEEEE**********)

**2. An active Azure account. If you don't have one, create a free account here:(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)**

**3. A resource group already created in Azure. If not, follow these steps:**
